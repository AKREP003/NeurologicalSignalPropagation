a function to predict the structure of neurons determined by the genetic encodings
for a given neurologic structure and given state a function to predict activity

Ligand gated channels, Voltage gated channels, Tension gated channels

Nernst equation,  Goldman equation

 i = g(- Eion + Vm) | driving force = Vm - E
